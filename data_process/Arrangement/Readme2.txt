the matlab version implements all the function(it has some small problems with lasso)
(preprocessing, sparse subspace clustering, and afterprocessing)

currently, please use python version

the python version can only do SSC and visualization, you can use python to solve SSC and use look_center.m to show the center of clusters.

I only include the most necessary code here which makes the repo more elegant I think. 

small dataset contains datasets with clear and simple syllables which can be used for simple test.
datasets with unclear or complex-shape syllables may be included later.
